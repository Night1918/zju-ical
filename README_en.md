- download from release page

- edit configs/server.json

  here is the fields description

  ~~~js
  {
    "enckey": "D*F-JaNdRgUkXp2s5v8y/B?E(H+KbPeS",//aes key(must be 128bits or 192bits or 256bits)"
    "host": "localhost", //host path(localhost or your server domain)
    "port": 3000, //must be number
    "config": "configs/config.json", //path to config.json, can be empty(default)

  }
  
  ~~~

- use `./zjuicalsrv` and open `host::port` to use!

### More configs

- we provide three config file under /configs: `upfile.json`, `config.json`, `server.json`
- `upfile.json` is used for zjuical to get username and password from file
- `config.json` is used for zjuical and zjuicalsrv to get generated config, which is highly recommended not to modify, but if you are not satisfied with the generated config, you can modify it with follow rules:
  ~~~js
  {
  "lastUpdated": 20220913, //just a flag
  "tweaks": [   //some holidays for zju course schedule changed
    {
      "TweakType": 2, //0:clear,1:copy,2:exchange
      "Description": "[国庆节] 放假调休，课程对调", //description
      "From": 20221006, //format YYYYMMDD
      "To": 20221008 
    },
  ],
  "termConfigs": [ // detailed term informations
    {
      "Year": "2022-2023",
      "Term": 0, // see pkg/zjuservice/class.go for details
      "Begin": 20220912,
      "End": 20221106,
      "FirstWeekNo": 1
    },
    {
      "Year": "2022-2023",
      "Term": 1,
      "Begin": 20221107,
      "End": 20230111,
      "FirstWeekNo": 1
    }
  ],
  "classTerms": [ //want query class terms, must be in termConfigs
    "2022-2023:0",//see pkg/zjuservice/class.go for details
    "2022-2023:1"
  ],
  "examTerms": [ // want query exam terms, must be in termConfigs
    "2022-2023:0"  //0 is fall and winter term, 1 is spring and summer term
  ]
  }

- server.json is used for zjuicalsrv to get server config, which is must modified for yourown server
- anyway, please don't move config file to another path(which is hard code!)
